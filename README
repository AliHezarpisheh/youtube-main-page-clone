# YouTube Main Page Clone

This project is a simple attempt at cloning the YouTube main page using pure HTML and CSS. It was one of the first projects I undertook at the beginning of my coding journey, primarily to learn a little about HTML and CSS and to observe frontend development concepts. As my interests evolved, I shifted towards backend development, but I wanted to upload this project to GitHub to showcase the progress I've made since then.
